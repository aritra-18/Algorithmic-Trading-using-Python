What is Algorithmic Trading?
Algorithmic Trading means using algorithms in buying and selling decisions in the financial market. In an algorithmic trading strategy, a set of predefined rules are used to determine when to buy a financial instrument and when to sell it.

In simple words, Algorithmic Trading is a way of buying and selling automatically and efficiently, which is always better than trading manually.

I hope you have understood what Algorithmic Trading means. In the section below, I will show an implementation of the momentum strategy in Algorithmic Trading using the Python programming language.
